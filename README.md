This Project follows TDD Mantra: "Red, Green, Refactor"

Step 1: Red: Write a test that fails.
Step 2: Green: Write code to make the test pass.
Step 3: Refactor: Optimize the code while ensuring all tests pass.

By following these steps iteratively, TDD helps build robust, testable, and maintainable software.
